# Tests getChildren()

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add three nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# List children when there are none
the children of n1 in graph1 are:

# List children when there is a self-edge
added edge e11 from n1 to n1 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e11)

# List children when there are more edges
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e13 from n1 to n3 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e11) n2(e12) n3(e13)

# List children when there is a cycle
added edge e23 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e31 from n3 to n1 in graph1
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(e23)
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n1(e31)
