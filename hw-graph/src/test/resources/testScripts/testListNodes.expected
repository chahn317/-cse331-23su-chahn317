# Tests getNodes()

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# List nodes in graph1 when empty
graph1 contains:

# List nodes in graph1 when not empty
added node n1 to graph1
graph1 contains: n1
added node n2 to graph1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
added node n3 to graph1
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3

# List nodes in graph1 when there are edges
added edge e11 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e13 from n1 to n3 in graph1
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3
