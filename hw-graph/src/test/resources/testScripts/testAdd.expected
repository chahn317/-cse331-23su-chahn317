# Tests addNode() and addEdge()

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add three nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add self-edge
added edge e11 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Add more edges
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e13 from n1 to n3 in graph1

# Add edge cycle
added edge e23 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e31 from n3 to n1 in graph1
